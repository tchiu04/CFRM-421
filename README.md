Course description: This course is an introduction to machine learning for an audience with a
background in quantitative finance. The course focuses on attaining both a theoretical understand-
ing of several machine learning models as well as gaining practical experience with implementing
them. Students learn to use well-tested and widely used Python implementations of machine learn-
ing algorithms instead of coding them from scratch. The following topics will be covered: an
overview of classification and regression techniques, support vector machines, decision trees, ran-
dom forests, and dimensionality reduction. We also discuss selected topics in unsupervised learning,
artificial neural networks and reinforcement learning.

Prerequisite(s): For CFRM 421, the prerequisites are CFRM 405 and CFRM 410. For CFRM
521, the prerequisite is CFRM 502. The course relies heavily on Python, and it is assumed that
you are well versed with Python. As a refresher, you may consult the following online resources:
learnpython.org and the PythonTutorial. As a rule of thumb, being able to at least solve easy
problems on at least the most basic data structures (such as lists, strings, numpy arrays...) from
leetcode.com is a good test to check that your python skills are adequate for this course. For the
project, it is also helpful to have familiarity with VS code and Git commands, although this is not
strictly necessary.

Textbooks: The course material is defined by the lecture notes. There is no required textbook.
The following textbook is recommended:
• G ́eron, A. Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow, 3rd edition,
O’Reilly, 2022. The electronic version can be obtained from the textbook website through
the UW Library
The course material will follow this textbook very closely.
